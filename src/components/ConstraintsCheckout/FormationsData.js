        formation: '4-3-3',
        description: 'This is a system that favours talented wingers. It is the formation that was most commonly used by the Impact in last year’s playoff run and it paid its dividends. The complementarity between the central midfielders is important to prevent the opponent from going quickly on a counter and to take advantage of the space on the wings, but the risk might be worth it.',

        formation: '4-5-1',
        description: 'The five midfielders in this type of formation give a bit of freedom to the manager. It is rare to see all five midfielders on the same line. The numerical advantage in the midfield allows to create layers and to limit space in between the lines, all the while allowing counter-attacking occasions to the offensive mids.',

        formation: '4-4-2',
        description: 'This is the basic modern formation. It is the best system to cover the space on a soccer field: six players cover 60% of the field in the middle (two centre backs, two centre mids, two forwards), while the wings are each covered by two players (a full-back and a winger). The weakness of this formation is found in between the lines: penetration becomes easier, as there are less layers to go through to get close to goal.',

        formation: '3-5-2',
        description: 'With three central defenders, three central midfielders and two forwards, many combinations become possible and space can be found on the wings, where only one player patrols the whole corridor. Most of the time the 3-5-2 is used when the team is in possession of the ball, but reverts to a 5-3-2 when defending, to suppress space and penetration possibilities on the sides.',

        formation: '3-4-3',
        description: 'A formation with a high attacking mindset. The midfielders are expected to split their time between attacking and defending. While having only three dedicated defenders which makes the team more vulnerable, the three forwards allow for a greater concentration on attack and stretch the opposition’s defensive line by providing more width.',

        formation: '5-3-2',
        description: 'The 5-3-2 is a cousin of the 3-5-2, but asks the wing players to play a little lower and to choose carefully the moments to get forward. The two forwards, on their side, have to be complementary: usually, one of the two is good with his back to goal and is more physical, while the other one is quicker and more technical.',
